Three side-by-side comparisons of tracking performance from the \handyseq{teaser} sequence. Our model allows us to obtain much higher tracking quality.

Tracking at a finer scale is instrumental to prevent tracking failure. 
% This comparison sequence can be seen in the \accepted{accompanying} \VideoHTrack{}.
