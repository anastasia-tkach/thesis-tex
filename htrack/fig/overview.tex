Overview of our algorithm. For each acquired frame we extract a 3D point cloud of the hand and the 2D distance transform of its silhouette. 
% 
From these we compute point correspondences to align a cylinder model of the hand to best match the data. This registration is performed in an ICP-like optimization that incorporates a number of regularizing priors to ensure accurate and robust tracking.
%fit our hand model to the data. In an ICP fashion, these correspondences are computed using the cylinder model posed and the silhouette image of from the previous solver iteration.
% 
%A number of priors regularize tracking, amongst which the result of previously tracked frames. Our solver optimizes for both joint angles and global transformation of a skeletal hand model.}
