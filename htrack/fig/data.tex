The two different sensors used in our experiments provide data with substantially different characteristics. Top: Intel's Creative Interactive Gesture camera (time of flight) provides a complete silhouette image \revision{$\SilhoSensor$}, but low quality depth measurements, resulting in severe noise in the point cloud \revision{$\PointsSensor$}. Bottom: Point clouds acquired by the PrimeSense camera (structured light) are much smoother, but the silhouette image can contain significant gaps.
