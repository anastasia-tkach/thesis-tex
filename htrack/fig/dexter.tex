\caption{
We quantitatively evaluate our algorithm on the \textbf{Dexter-1} dataset from \protect\cite{sridhar_iccv13}. The measurements report the root mean square errors of fingertip placements. The acquisition setup consists of several calibrated video cameras and a single depth camera. For our results and the method of~\protect\cite{tang_cvpr14}, only the depth image is used for tracking, while the algorithms of Sridhar and colleagues also use the video streams. The blue, green, and purple bars are reproduced from~\protect\cite{sridhar_14}.
For our algorithm we report results without (red) and with (orange) reinitialization.
