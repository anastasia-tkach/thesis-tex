Developing robust model-based tracking is essential to enable tracking of hands interacting with each other or with other objects in the environment.
Here we illustrate that for our method tracking accuracy is not significantly affected even though we are not modeling the second hand.
Note that such motion cannot be tracked successfully by appearance-based methods such as~\protect\cite{tompson2014real}.
%how our method is robust to the point that even though we are not modeling the second hand, the tracking is not significantly affected. Note such motion cannot be tracked successfully by appearance-based methods such as~\protect\cite{tompson_tog14}.

% Here, we illustrate such a situation and show how the appearance based method in \protect\cite{tompson_tog14} loses tracking. Our method is robust to the point that even though we are not modeling the second hand, the tracking is not significantly affected.
