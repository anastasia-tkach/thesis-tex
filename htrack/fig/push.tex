Our 2D silhouette registration energy is essential to avoid tracking errors for occluded parts of the hand.
When no depth data is available for certain parts of the model, a plausible pose is inferred by ensuring that the model is contained within the sensor silhouette image $\SilhoSensor$.
% correctly track occluded geometry. In these scenarios, it is the lack of data of depth measurements in certain areas that drives pose inference - by ensuring our model is behind by the sensor silhouette $\SilhoSensor$.
