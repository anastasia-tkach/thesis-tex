% We assume that while there is no new measurements, an estimate of the current hand parameters are the previous known parameters up to Gaussian noise, that is $x_n = x_{n-1} + w_{n-1}$. We also assume for now that depth sensor noise is normally distributed, which actually is not the case. Thus, the states of our system can be approximated as following:
% Define  to be initial state estimate at  and  to be a state estimate after updating on the measurement .
