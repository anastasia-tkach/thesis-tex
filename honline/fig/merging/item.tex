We estimate the parameter $\mu$ from two measurements $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$; these measurements are associated with uncertainty ellipsoids represented as their covariance matrices $\cov_1$ and $\cov_2$. The information in these two estimates can be compound, resulting in the joint estimate $\tilde{\mu}$.
% \AT{can you generate a 2nd one that is slightly different for the right hand side? Perhaps even take two examples directly from \Figure{intra}?}
